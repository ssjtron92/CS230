Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! As a passionate Java developer, I focus on creating efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository showcases my skills in Java programming, particularly in implementing design patterns and building robust applications.

Gaming Room Application
Description
The Gaming Room application demonstrates my ability to apply the Singleton design pattern in a practical context. This Java-based project includes a game management system where games can be added, retrieved, and listed. Key features include:

Singleton Pattern: Ensuring a single instance of the GameService class across the application.
Immutable Objects: The Team class is designed to be immutable, with no setters, ensuring thread safety and consistency.
Efficient Data Retrieval: Efficiently fetching game data by ID or name, showcasing optimized search algorithms within a collection.
Code Highlights
GameService: A singleton class managing the game instances.
Team: An immutable class representing a team with ID and name.
ProgramDriver: The main entry point of the application demonstrating the initialization and usage of the singleton instance.
SingletonTester: A class designed to test and validate the singleton behavior in the application.
